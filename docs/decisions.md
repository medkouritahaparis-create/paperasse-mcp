# Architecture decision log

Each entry: context, options, decision, why.

## 2026-10-26 — MCP Python SDK v2 (`MCPServer`, not `FastMCP`)

- **Context:** `uv add "mcp[cli]"` installs mcp 2.3.0, where `FastMCP` is renamed `MCPServer` (`from mcp.server.mcpserver import MCPServer`).
- **Options:** pin `mcp<2` to keep the `FastMCP` API, or use v2.
- **Decision:** use v2 and `MCPServer`.
- **Why:** it's a new project with no legacy code to protect, and v2 is the maintained line. Same decorator style (`@mcp.tool()`).

## 2026-10-26 — Data source: DILA "particuliers" feed, schema 3.5

- **Context:** service-public.fr publishes its fiches as open data (Licence Ouverte) on data.gouv.fr. v3.3 was removed on 4 May 2026, and the current version is 3.5.
- **Decision:** ingest `https://lecomarquage.service-public.gouv.fr/vdd/3.5/part/zip/vosdroits-latest.zip` (about 24 MB, 5,572 XML files). The version is the `FEED_VERSION` constant in `paperasse/ingest.py`. Only `F*.xml` files (fiches, 3,004 on 2026-10-26) are parsed for now. `N*` files (themes/folders) and `R*` files (resources: forms, glossary, online services) can come later.
- **Why:** the official XML is the source of truth, is updated daily and has stable IDs and URLs. The vectorised Hugging Face mirror (AgentPublic/service-public) is derived data and would add a dependency we don't need yet.

## 2026-10-26 — Render fiche text as plain Markdown, verbatim

- **Context:** the server must return source text and never paraphrase it. The XML mixes content with presentation (`MiseEnEvidence`), questionnaire logic (`Questionnaire`, `Condition`) and case tabs (`BlocCas`/`Cas`, `ListeSituations`/`Situation`).
- **Options:** (a) return raw XML, (b) strip all tags to one blob, (c) render to light Markdown that keeps structure.
- **Decision:** (c). Chapters, cases and situations become headings, with the level following nesting depth. Lists become `-` / `1.`, tables become Markdown tables, and callouts become `À noter : …` using the label from the XML. Online services, notices and offices become `Titre (URL)` followed by their own text. Questionnaire logic is dropped. **All cases are kept:** the server doesn't know the user's situation, so the client picks the relevant case.
- **Why:** an LLM reads headings and lists well, and keeping every case means nothing is silently filtered out. No words are added except the XML's own labels.
- **Verified:** a script compared every `Paragraphe` in the source with the output across all 3,004 fiches. The only paragraphs not reproduced are image and video descriptions (transcripts and alt text), which are excluded on purpose. 82 "Recherche guidée" fiches are hubs with no body text: they keep their metadata and an empty `text`.

## 2026-10-26 — Two dates per fiche

- **Decision:** `updated_at` comes from `dc:date` ("modified YYYY-MM-DD"; present on every fiche, and the date to cite). `important_update_at` comes from `dateDerniereModificationImportante` (present on about 58% of fiches; marks substantive changes).
- **Why:** the rules require a last-update date on every result. `dc:date` is the only one that is always present.
